# MazeEnv
# Q-Learning UMS8550 Project
This project showcases a Q-Learning algorithm applied to a custom environment themed around a fairy tale scenario. It includes Python scripts for the environment setup (maze_env.py), the Q-Learning implementation (Q_learning.py), and the main simulation (main.py). Visual assets are provided to enhance the simulation's engagement. This project is ideal for those interested in reinforcement learning and AI, offering a hands-on approach to understanding Q-Learning in a creative and interactive context.

# Project Structure
main.py: The main script to run the simulation.
maze_env.py: Defines the custom environment used for the Q-Learning algorithm.
Q_learning.py: Contains the implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
q_table.npy: A saved Q-table used for the agent's learning process.
Visual Assets: Various images (e.g., Background.webp, castle.jpeg, Cinderella.png, etc.) used to visually represent different states and outcomes in the simulation.

# Installation

# 1.Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Umajanavi/MazeEnv.git

# 2.Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3.Install the gym library:
pip install gym

# Usage
Run the Simulation:

# 1.Execute the main.py script to start the Q-Learning simulation.
python main.py

# 2.Environment Setup:

The environment is defined in maze_env.py. You can modify it to test different scenarios and configurations.

# 3.Q-Learning Algorithm:

The core algorithm is implemented in Q_learning.py. Adjust parameters like learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to see how they affect the learning process.

# Customization
